# Deep Metric Learning Research in PyTorch

## What can I find here?

This repository contains all code and implementations used in:

```
Revisiting Training Strategies and Generalization Performance in Deep Metric Learning
```

accepted to **ICML 2020**.

**Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08473

The code is meant to serve as a research starting point in Deep Metric Learning.
By implementing key baselines under a consistent setting and logging a vast set of metrics, it should be easier to ensure that method gains are not due to implementational variations, while better understanding driving factors.

It is set up in a modular way to allow for fast and detailed prototyping, but with key elements written in a way that allows the code to be directly copied into other pipelines. In addition, multiple training and test metrics are logged in W&B to allow for easy and large-scale evaluation.

Finally, please find a public W&B repo with key runs performed in (1) here: https://app.wandb.ai/confusezius/RevisitDML.

## Paper-related Information

#### Reproduce results from our paper **[Revisiting Training Strategies and Generalization Performance in Deep Metric Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08473.pdf)**

* *ALL* standardized Runs that were used are available in `Revisit_Runs.sh`.
* These runs are also logged in this public W&B repo: https://app.wandb.ai/confusezius/RevisitDML.
* All Runs and their respective metrics can be downloaded and evaluated to generate the plots in our paper by following `Result_Evaluations.py`. This also allows for potential introspection of other relations. It also converts results directly into Latex-table format with mean and standard deviations.
* To utilize different batch-creation methods, simply set the flag `--data_sampler` to the method of choice. Allowed flags are listed in `datasampler/__init__.py`.
* To use the proposed spectral regularization for tuple-based methods, set `--batch_mining rho_distance` with flip probability `--miner_rho_distance_cp e.g. 0.2`.
* A script to run the toy experiments in the paper is provided in `toy_experiments`.

**Note**: There may be small deviations in results based on the Hardware (e.g. between P100 and RTX GPUs) and Software (different PyTorch/Cuda versions) used to run these experiments, but they should be covered in the standard deviations reported in the paper.

* CARS196 (https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html)
* Stanford Online Products (http://cvgl.stanford.edu/projects/lifted_struct/)

can be downloaded either from the respective project sites or directly via Dropbox:

* CUB200-2011 (1.08 GB): https://www.dropbox.com/s/tjhf7fbxw5f9u0q/cub200.tar?dl=0
* CARS196 (1.86 GB): https://www.dropbox.com/s/zi2o92hzqekbmef/cars196.tar?dl=0

**The latter ensures that the folder structure is already consistent with this pipeline and the dataloaders**.   

Otherwise, please make sure that the datasets have the following internal structure:

* For CUB200-2011/CARS196:
```
cub200/cars196
└───images
|    └───001.Black_footed_Albatross
|           │   Black_Footed_Albatross_0001_796111
|           │   ...
|    ...
```

* For Stanford Online Products:
```
online_products
└───images
|    └───bicycle_final
|           │   111085122871_0.jpg
|    ...
|
└───Info_Files
|    │   bicycle.txt
|    │   ...
```

Assuming your folder is placed in e.g. `<$datapath/cub200>`, pass `$datapath` as input to `--source`.

### Training:
Training is done by using `main.py` and setting the respective flags, all of which are listed and explained in `parameters.py`. A vast set of exemplary runs is provided in `Revisit_Runs.sh`.

**[I.]** **A basic sample run using default parameters would like this**:

```
python main.py --loss margin --batch_mining distance --log_online \
              --project DML_Project --group Margin_with_Distance --seed 0 \
              --gpu 0 --bs 112 --data_sampler class_random --samples_per_class 2 \
              --arch resnet50_frozen_normalize --source $datapath --n_epochs 150 \
              --lr 0.00001 --embed_dim 128 --evaluate_on_gpu
```

The purpose of each flag explained:

* `--loss <loss_name>`: Name of the training objective used. See folder `criteria` for implementations of these methods.
* `--batch_mining <batchminer_name>`: Name of the batch-miner to use (for tuple-based ranking methods). See folder `batch_mining` for implementations of these methods.
* `--log_online`: Log metrics online via either W&B (Default) or CometML. Regardless, plots, weights and parameters are all stored offline as well.
*  `--project`, `--group`: Project name as well as name of the run. Different seeds will be logged into the same `--group` online. The group as well as the used seed also define the local savename.
* `--seed`, `--gpu`, `--source`: Basic Parameters setting the training seed, the used GPU and the path to the parent folder containing the respective Datasets.
* `--arch`: The utilized backbone, e.g. ResNet50. You can append `_frozen` and `_normalize` to the name to ensure that BatchNorm layers are frozen and embeddings are normalized, respectively.
* `--data_sampler`, `--samples_per_class`: How to construct a batch. The default method, `class_random`, selects classes at random and places `<samples_per_class>` samples into the batch until the batch is filled.
* `--lr`, `--n_epochs`, `--bs` ,`--embed_dim`: Learning rate, number of training epochs, the batchsize and the embedding dimensionality.  
* `--evaluate_on_gpu`: If set, all metrics are computed using the gpu - requires Faiss-GPU and may need additional GPU memory.

#### Some Notes:
* During training, metrics listed in `--evaluation_metrics` will be logged for both training and validation/test set. If you do not care about detailed training metric logging, simply set the flag `--no_train_metrics`. A checkpoint is saved for improvements in metrics listed in `--storage_metrics` on training, validation or test sets.
* If one wishes to use a training/validation split, simply set `--use_tv_split` and `--tv_split_perc <train/val split percentage>`.


**[II.]** **Advanced Runs**:

```
python main.py --loss margin --batch_mining distance --loss_margin_beta 0.6 --miner_distance_lower_cutoff 0.5 ... (basic parameters)
```

* To use specific parameters that are loss, batchminer or e.g. datasampler-related, simply set the respective flag.
* For structure and ease of use, parameters relating to a specifc loss function/batchminer etc. are marked as e.g. `--loss_<lossname>_<parameter_name>`, see `parameters.py`.
* However, every parameter can be called from every class, as all parameters are stored in a shared namespace that is passed to all methods. This makes it easy to create novel fusion losses and the likes.


### Evaluating Results with W&B
Here some information on using W&B (highly encouraged!)

* Create an account here (free): https://wandb.ai
* After the account is set, make sure to include your API key in `parameters.py` under `--wandb_key`.
* To make sure that W&B data can be stored, ensure to run `wandb on` in the folder pointed to by `--save_path`.
* When data is logged online to W&B, one can use `Result_Evaluations.py` to download all data, create named metric and correlation plots and output a summary in the form of a latex-ready table with mean and standard deviations of all metrics. **This ensures that there are no errors between computed and reported results.**


### Creating custom methods:

1. **Create custom objectives**: Simply take a look at e.g. `criteria/margin.py`, and ensure that the used methods has the following properties:
  * Inherit from `torch.nn.Module` and define a custom `forward()` function.
  * When using trainable parameters, make sure to either provide a `self.lr` to set the learning rate of the loss-specific parameters, or set `self.optim_dict_list`, which is a list containing optimization dictionaries passed to the optimizer (see e.g `criteria/proxynca.py`). If both are set, `self.optim_dict_list` has priority.
  * Depending on the loss, remember to set the variables `ALLOWED_MINING_OPS  = None or list of allowed mining operations`, `REQUIRES_BATCHMINER = False or True`, `REQUIRES_OPTIM = False or True` to denote if the method needs a batchminer or optimization of internal parameters.


2. **Create custom batchminer**: Simply take a look at e.g. `batch_mining/distance.py` - The miner needs to be a class with a defined `__call__()`-function, taking in a batch and labels and returning e.g. a list of triplets.

3. **Create custom datasamplers**:Simply take a look at e.g. `datasampler/class_random_sampler.py`. The sampler needs to inherit from `torch.utils.data.sampler.Sampler` and has to provide a `__iter__()` and a `__len__()` function. It has to yield a set of indices that are used to create the batch.
