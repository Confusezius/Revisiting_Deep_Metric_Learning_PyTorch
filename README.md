## Deep Metric Learning Research in PyTorch

This repository will contain all code and implementations used in:

(1) https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08473
```
Revisiting Training Strategies and Generalization Performance in Deep Metric Learning
```

and

(2) https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13458
```
DiVA: Diverse Visual Feature Aggregation for Deep Metric Learning
```


It is set up in a modular way to allow for fast and detailed prototyping. In addition, multiple training and test metrics are logged in WandB to allow for easy and large-scale evaluation.


*WandB-Results for key runs in (1) will be made available as well.*
